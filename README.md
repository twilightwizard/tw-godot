# godot
I am learning how to use the Godot game engine.  This repository of code will contain the example projects
I do while accomplishing that task.  If any of this helps you, then feel free to use this code under the MIT license.  The purpose
of all of this work is to set myself up to write exercise games using the Wii Balance board and a webcam or phone with motion detection
as the game controllers interfaced to Godot.   All of these examples are backups of my studying those topics.

Projects I will slowly be developing.   This is where I would like to go at a the moment.
1.  Use line2D node to draw a face on the screen and deploy it to Windows, HTTP and Android platforms.
   - Done.   Checked into release branch.

3.  Create a 2D random maze drawing GDscript
4.  Create a 3D maze game using what I learn from step 2
5.  Create a Nintendo Wii interface to Godot so that I can use the Wii balance board as a controller.  A
    Wii balance board is just a bluetooth device so can directly communicate with your PC.
    - Done.  Not shown but just use the WiiBalanceWalker program to make Wii motions to keyboard keystrokes.

6.  Use steps 2-4 to navigate through the 3D maze using a Wii balance board.
7.  Make other exercise games using sensors on stationary bikes and Wii nun-chucks to play while exercising.
8.  Create an AI engine in c that communicates with Godot and handles motion detection of common objects like pistols in your hands
    as game controllers.

Feel free to steal any of these ideas.   I will be doing this slowly so if you get something working before
me, just give me a shout so I can look at what you have done.

Branches:
  - release = projects that should work.
  - develop = various misc. things I am working on.   A lot of this are work in progress or trial and error examaples are don't work.
