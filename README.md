# godot
I am learning how to use the Godot game engine.  This repository of code will contain the example projects
I do while accomplishing that task.  If any of this helps you, then feel free to use this code under the MIT license.

Projects I will slowly be developing.   This is where I would like to go at a the moment.
1.  Use line2D node to draw a face on the screen and deploy it to Windows, HTTP and Android platforms.
2.  Create a 2D random maze drawing GDscript
3.  Create a 3D maze game using what I learn from step 2
4.  Create a Nintendo Wii interface to Godot so that I can use the Wii balance board as a controller.  A
    Wii balance board is just a bluetooth device so can directly communicate with your PC.
5.  Use steps 2-4 to navigate through the 3D maze using a Wii balance board.
6.  Make other exercise games using sensors on stationary bikes and Wii nun-chucks to play while exercising.
   
Feel free to steal any of these ideas.   I will be doing this slowly so if you get something working before
me, just give me a shout so I can look at what you have done.
